## Adding screenshots to markdown

1) Upload your image to [imgur](http://imgur.com/).

2) Copy your imgur URL (with file extension). For a URL of [http://i.imgur.com/GQNaCZu.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GQNaCZu.jpg),
you would use the following syntax in `readme.md`:

```
![](http://i.imgur.com/GQNaCZu.jpg)
```

Example:
